# Acton Hackerspace #
An after-school program to expand the depth and breadth of the students' skillset in Technology.

Goal: To teach the group the skills needed to design and build new products, as well as repair broken products. Students must be able to use the skills learned in the hackerspace to implement their own vision.

## Programming ##

In the programming segment of hackerspace we will focus on learning Python through a series of exercises to be completed in class or on their own time. In addition to the nuts-and-bolts of syntax we will think about software design, and eventually build an online student tracker for keeping tabs on students at Acton (level, goals, achievements, eagle bucks)!

### Prerequisites for programming ###
0. Working Computer
1. Install python
  * [On OSX](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * [On Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * On ChromeOS
    * [Install Crouton](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-install-linux-on-a-chromebook-and-unlock-its-ful-509039343)
    * Install python (see linux)
    * Install text editor
  * [On Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Programming concepts ###
0. Algorithms
  * bring all the materials needed to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and walk through the steps to create a sandwich in excruciating detail. Such that the 'Acton Automaton' can make the sandwich.
    * Keywords
      * Stand/Sit
      * Open/Close
      * Grab/Release (pick/put)
      * Place
      * Spread (action/stop)
      * Flip
  * Ask students to pick a task they perform regularly and to detail an algorithm to teach the 'Acton Automaton' how to perform it.
1. Binary numbers
1. Syntax
2. Interpreters / Compilers
3. Functions (methods)
4. Objects

### Programming in practice ###

The basic lessons will go (roughly) as follows:

0. Installation of Python.
1. Hello World: Start with the basic hello world message, modify to allow the user to input their name, and have it print hello <name>.
  * see `hello.py`
  * comments
  * receiving inputs
  * basic variables and assignment operator
  * print statement
    * Use hyphens (-), plus signs (+), and pipes (|) to print a tic-tac-toe board:
  ```
     |   |
  ---+---+---
     |   |
  ---+---+---
     |   |
  ```
2. Variables: have the students experiment with different datatypes
  * see `variables.py`
  * integers
  * strings
  * floats
  * typecasting
  * _custom classes??_
3. Operators
  * covered somewhat in `variables.py`
  * **Resturant bill calculator**
  * math operators
  * assignment
  * comparison
  * order of operations
4. If-then-else statements
  * see `control_statements.py`
  * elif
  * inline
5. Looping structures
  * see `looping_structures.py`
  * for
  * while
  1. LEVEL TEST - arbitrarily sized tic-tac-toe board
    * see `advanced_tic_tac_toe.py`
6. Try-Except
  * see `exception_handling.py`
  * else
  * finally
9. functions (methods)
  * see 'functional_programming.py'
  * accepting values (**kwargs)
  * returning values
7. Data structures
  * see `data_structures.py`
  * tuples
  * lists
  * dicts
    * see `dictionaries.py`
10. Objects
8. databases
8. strings in depth??
  * built in string functions
  * _regular expressions?_
