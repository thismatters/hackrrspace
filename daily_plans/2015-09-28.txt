Hackrrspace Automaton:
    Introduce student to concept of an 'algorithm'.
        A step-by-step problem-solving procedure.
        Simple steps
        Finite number of steps
    Ask students to brainstorm an algorithm for adding two large numbers.
        critique algorithm
    Ask students to brainstorm an algorithm for making ramen noodles
        critique algorithm
        decide minimum commands that the automaton must know to complete the algorithm
    Automaton makes a sandwich
        Decide minimum commands to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
        Choose automaton (will not write algorithm, but will learn commands)
        Students break into groups to write algorithm for making a sandwich
        Students will give instructions to automaton in making sandwich!

Continued hackerspace automaton:
    Formalized syntax for the various commands needed.
    Free time for students to work on their algorithm and test with an automaton of their choosing

2015-10-05
Continued hackerspace automaton:
    Showed all students the formalized syntax
    Started "lightning round" to test students final algorithms

2015-10-06
Continued hackerspace autamoton:
    Finished the 'lightning round'. Peyton won.
    Students started writing an algorithm for making ramen noodles.
Started installing python on the research machines.

    prepare emulsion
    apply emulsion to screen, put away to dry
    Spend rest of time designing hackrrspace logo!
