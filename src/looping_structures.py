""" Last time (in control_statements.py) we learned about the 
if-statement, and how it can control which blocks of code get executed.
This time we will learn how to make certain blocks of code execute many 
times. 

Before getting in to that let's learn about a new data type. 
In addition to numbers (integers and floats) and strings, there is also 
a type called 'Boolean'. A boolean variable is either True or False.

for-loops. It is called 'range()', and it will return a list of numbers

range(5) returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
range(10) returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
range(1, 6) returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
range(10, 5, -1) returns [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]
